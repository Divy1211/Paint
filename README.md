# Paint
1. I have coded a Paint program in Processing (a java animations library), my code is a bit messy but i think it will be readable enough. You can run the code in the Processing Developement Environment (PDE) itself.  
2. It has very basic functionality only . If you find a bug you can open a pull request

# Prerequisites
1. You should have Java installed.
2. You should also download and install the [Processing Developement Environment](https://processing.org/)

# How the program works

1. Click on any colour to change colours
2. Click on a line width to select line width
3. You can save your image by pressing 's'
